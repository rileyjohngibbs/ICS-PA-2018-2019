# Intro to Computer Science, Period A: 2018-2019 School Year

Files for the Intro to Computer Science course, Period A, for the 2018-2019 school year at Crossroads School.

## Copying Files to Your Machine

Individual files can be copy-pasted into your own local copies of these files, but that is not necessarily the most efficient way to retrieve them.

Slightly better, particularly if you need several files, is to either download the entire repo as a zip file, or to clone the repo with git.

### Downloading as a Zip File

From the project's [root directory](https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ICS-PA-2018-2019), click the big green "Clone or Download" button and click "Download ZIP." This will create a zip file on your computer, most likely in your Downloads folder. Double-click that file from your Finder to unzip it, which will create a folder with all the contents of this repository.

### Cloning the Repo

From the project's [root directory](https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ICS-PA-2018-2019), click the big green "Clone or Download" button. Make sure the dialog box that pops up says "Clone with HTTPS." If not, click the "Use HTTPS" link in the corner of the box.

Copy the URL in the box to your clipboard (command-c).

Open a terminal window and navigate to where you want to place the files.

Use the `git clone` command to clone the repo to a new directory in your current location.

For example:

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ICS-PA-2018-2019.git
```
